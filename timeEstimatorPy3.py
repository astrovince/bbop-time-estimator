# 27/09/2019 - I have verified now that I get the same prediction of the spectral
#              density for the foregrounds as shown by AP in his slides, yet I have
#              exactly a factor of 2 in the background predictions per pixel per filter
#              It seems AP shows the background spectrum summing both polarisations but
#              computes the foreground prediction for a single polarisation...
# 07/10/2019 - We have clarified that: because the pixels is covered with devices that
#              have absorbing dipoles in only one orientation (each of the 4 thermometer
#              carries only one orientation of absorbing dipoles), the pixel is 
#              effectively sensitive to only 1/2 of the power for non-polarized light.
# 14/10/2019 - Prediction of total power sensitivities now complete and verified to be
#              compatible with previous estimations (when using same initial values).

    """
    This script returns the sensitivity (mJy for a point source, MJy/sr for an
    extended source) of a map on a user provided area and signal-to-noise ratio.
    It makes the computation for all three bands of B-BOP.
    its arguments are:
        - ston   signal to noise (dimensionless)
        - area   the area to map (degrees)
        - mode   this is the observing mode, chosen among accepted values
        - goal   (T/F) is a flag to use the goal detector NEP rather than the requirement
                 default is False
        - silent if true will not print the results
    Note that there is an underlying assumption that the signal to noise that
    matters to the used (the input here) is the one measured after object photometry
    has been performed, which means subtraction of a background in one way or another, 
    that leads to a factor sqrt(2) on the pixel rms (at least).
    Furthermore for point sources, the S/N from the user point of view is the S/N
    measured in a aperture around the source. We take the convention that the aperture
    is the same as the one used to characterise the Encircled Energy Fraction (in other
    words the aperture is fixed to the profile of the PSF). Here we have characterised it
    by eefD4 and diam4 which are the diameter of an aperture of surface equal to that
    of 4 pixels, and the fraction of energy inside that circle. So effectively the aperture
    photometry is performed on 4 pixels, which relaxes the level of the noise by a 
    factor 2 with respect to the noise per pixel.
